I am a software engineer, educator, designer, maker, and undoubtedly many other things. I'm interested in building tools that help people accomplish their goals quicker, more efficiently, and with delight. 

When not doing the above, I fill time reading, swing dancing, making 2-d plotter art, and cooking. 

Recommendations welcome.
