The other week, I had a fun little language nerd-out with an acquaintance who said they had learned Elder Futhark. In an attempt to provide a little laugh in these crazy times, I made the following little plotter card for them:

{% 
include caption-img.html 
image="elder_futhark-card_front.jpg" 
caption="Front of card the card with hastily translated set-up" 
alt = "A folded card with the following written on it: Which writing system is the best to use for the following? the (m) (Spanish) there (Dutch) rich (Chinese) s (with a lisp) very large board (English)"
%}

{% 
include caption-img.html image="elder_futhark-card_back.jpg" caption="Back of card the the punch line"
alt = "A folded card with the words Elder Futhark written in the Elder Futhark writing system."
