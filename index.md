I am a software engineer, educator, designer, maker, and undoubtedly many other things. I enjoy building tools that help people accomplish their goals quicker, more efficiently, and with delight. 

I've built such tools at organizations like [Rainier Scholars](https://www.rainierscholars.org/) and [Pacific Science Center](https://www.pacificsciencecenter.org/). I tend to explore, learn, and use languages and tools that fit the need for the job. So far that has included Python, FileMaker, SQL, JavaScript, C++, MkDocs, R, QGIS, and git.

When not doing the above, I fill my time reading, swing dancing, making 2-d plotter art, trying out new cookbooks, and vacuuming up corgi floof.
